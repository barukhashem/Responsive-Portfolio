      <p>I’ve always had a grand sense of adventure and a desire to experience new places. As a result, I’ve traveled quite a bit and have had many good (and some not-so-good) experiences. Among my travels, I’ve been all over the United States, including Hawaii, parts of Canada and Mexico, the Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>

      <p>Some of the highlights of my adventures include serving in Haiti with hospital medical mission teams and school-building teams, backpacking across Europe, riding the trains and ferries from one end of the Mediterranean to the other end and back, hiking Mt. Olympus in Greece, and working at an archaeological excavation in Israel. I’ve also experienced guest hospitality in the homes of Dutch, French, Greek, Israeli, and Italian families while traveling abroad.</p>

      <p>I’ve been very fortunate to have had many adventures and experienced so much during my early adult years. My travels have been by far some of the best experiences of my life, and I wouldn’t trade them for anything. Being an avid traveler and a born adventurer, traveling is therefore one of my many passions in which I delight because it helps keep me young at heart.</p>
